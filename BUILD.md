Log on as "root" or make sure that you "use" sudo with every single command.

Perform a package update:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    
Install Apache 2 for hosting, PHP for code execution on the server, the Apache2 PHP module to enable integration of PHP in Apache, Git to clone this repository, MPD for playing music on your server and MPC to enable integration in PHP:
    
    apt-get install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php git mpd mpc
    
If this didn't work or you want to install PHP 5 instead:

    apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 git mpd mpc
    
Clone this repository:
